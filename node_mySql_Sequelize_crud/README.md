I have create one project in node js and also use sequelize ORM for database manage.

Routes ===>

studentRoutes -> simple crud
user-address -> one to one Relationship (User - Address)
kide-game -> one to many Relationship (Kide - Game)
clgStd-branch -> many to many Relationship (ClgStudent - Branch, ClgStudentBranch)
